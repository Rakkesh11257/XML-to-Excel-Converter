XML to Excel Converter

Description:
This Python script converts XML files containing digital asset information into an Excel file for easy analysis and reference. It categorizes assets based on their lifecycle status and identifies approved assets with missing data.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
pandas library
XML files containing digital asset information
Usage:

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Install the pandas library if not already installed: pip install pandas.
Place the XML files containing digital asset information in a folder.
Update the folder_path variable in the script to point to the folder containing XML files.
Specify the output Excel file path by updating the output_excel variable in the script.
Run the script. The Excel file will be generated with categorized asset information.
Example:

python
Copy code
import os
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
import pandas as pd

# Function to extract data from XML files and create Excel
def create_excel_from_xml(folder_path, output_excel):
    # Function implementation...

# Example usage
folder_path = r"Path\to\XML\files"
output_excel = r"Output\Excel\File.xlsx"
create_excel_from_xml(folder_path, output_excel)
Notes:

Ensure XML files are correctly formatted to avoid parsing errors.
Review the generated Excel file for categorized asset information.
